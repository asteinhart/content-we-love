We talk to a Christian climate scientist about how she became a climate skeptic whisperer, by convincing others not only that climate change is real, but that taking action should be central to their faith. We also talk to a young Evangelical who shares what it\u2019s like to come to believe in climate change...and have to tell your parents.Guests: Katharine Hayhoe, Chief Scientist at The Nature Conservancy, Abigail ZoccolaCalls to Action If you\u2019re a Christian listener and you want to bring the conversation about climate change to your church, check out these resources and a bible study from YECA, as well as Katharine Hayhoe\u2019s website  Check out Katharine Hayhoe\u2019s new book, Saving Us: A Climate Scientist\u2019s Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World  Abigail recommends reading Laudato Si: On Care for Our Common Home by Pope Francis, and Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer Check out our episode Trying to Talk to Your Family About Climate Change?
