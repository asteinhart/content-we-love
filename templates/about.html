  <h3>What is this?</h3>
  <p>
    This is the continuation of a long-running project which I drastically revamp every year or so. 
    It started with my friends and I sending each other interesting things on the internet as most 
    people do. Knowing that I was missing out on great content that my friends were sending other people, 
    I started <a
    href="https://thecommunitytab.substack.com/p/introducing-the-tab"
    target="_blank"
    >The Tab</a> which was a project to collect the most interesting and inspiring content from you and 
    your friends, share it, and provide a list of some of the highlights, curated by other members of the community. 
    After about half a year of The Tab, we revived it with  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecontentclub/" target="_blank"
    >Content Club</a>, moving to a subreddit to place a greater 
    emphasis on discussing this content. That brings us to Content We Love, a project to compile all the fun content 
    we have collected and present it in a visually appealing way. This also was a great project to build my web 
    development skills. I hope you enjoy it and find something compelling.

  <h3>Can I submit a piece of content I recently found?</h3>

    Yes of course! Please use the form

    This looks a lot like

      >NPR's Books We Love</a
    >?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Glad you noticed! This project was inspired by NPR's Books We Love (formerly
    the Book Concierge). Although it was not used much in my project, NPR does
    post the
    <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/book-concierge" target="_blank">code</a>
    for their site which is fun.

  <h3>What are some of your favorite pieces of content?</h3>
  <p>Coming soon!</p>
  <h3>
    I'm dying to know details about the technical implementation, please do
    share.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Well, if you must know... The site uses Flask (a python framework) as a
    backend that fetches the data from the Airtable API. A python package
    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/url-metadata/" target="_blank"
      >url-metadata</a
    >
    was used to scrape cover images and descriptions for content when available.
    Layout and interaction are done through vanilla JS and CSS. The site is
    hosted on Heroku. Code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/asteinhart/content-we-love/" target="_blank"
    >here</a>.
